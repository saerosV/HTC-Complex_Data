It is often useful to be able to tell whether the first part of a sequence of 
characters matches a given pattern. In this problem you will design a (somewhat 
limited) way of doing this.

PROBLEM:

Now design a function that consumes Pattern and ListOf1String and produces true 
if the pattern matches the ListOf1String. For example,

(pattern-match? (list "V" "6" "T" "1" "Z" "4")
                (list "A" "N" "A" "N" "A" "N"))

should produce true. If the ListOf1String is longer than the pattern, but the 
first part matches the whole pattern produce true. If the ListOf1String is 
shorter than the Pattern you should produce false.       

Treat this as the design of a function operating on 2 complex data. After your 
signature and purpose, you should write out a cross product of type comments 
table. You should reduce the number of cases in your cond to 4 using the table, 
and you should also simplify the cond questions using the table.
