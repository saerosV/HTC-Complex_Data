PROBLEM:

Remember the functions we wrote last week to calculate the total
area of all images in an image organizer.

Use local to encapsulate the functions so that total-area-dir,
total-area--lod , total-area--loi and image-area are private to
a new function called total-area. 

Be sure to revise the signature, purpose, tests etc.
